## Remaining Issues to Address

### ðŸ”„ **Command Structure Simplification**

**Current Issue**: Some command redundancy and inconsistent patterns still exist
```bash
# Still has some redundancy:
maestro delete vdb my-vdb
maestro vdb delete my-vdb  # Both work, but inconsistent

# Some inconsistent patterns remain:
maestro create document VDB_NAME COLL_NAME DOC_NAME --file-name=FILE
maestro document create --name=DOC_NAME --file=FILE --vdb=VDB_NAME --collection=COLL_NAME
```

**Recommendation**: 
- Standardize on one pattern per operation type
- Remove redundant command variations
- Ensure consistent flag usage across all commands

### ðŸ”„ **Resource Naming Standardization**

**Current Issue**: Some mixed naming conventions still exist
```bash
# Still see variations:
maestro list vector-dbs
maestro vectordb list  # Both work, but inconsistent
```

**Recommendation**:
- Choose one primary naming convention
- Keep aliases for backward compatibility
- Update documentation to use consistent terms

### ðŸ”„ **Default VDB Support**

**Current Issue**: Users must specify VDB name for every operation
```bash
# Currently required for every command:
maestro collection list --vdb=my-vdb
maestro document list --vdb=my-vdb --collection=my-coll
```

**Recommendation**:
- Add support for setting a default VDB
- Allow operations without explicit VDB specification
- Provide clear indication of which VDB is being used

### ðŸ”„ **Output Formatting Improvements**

**Current Issue**: Limited output format options
```bash
# Currently only text output:
maestro vectordb list
# No JSON, YAML, or table formats available
```

**Recommendation**:
- Add `--output=json|yaml|table` flag
- Improve table formatting for list commands
- Add structured output for scripting

### ðŸ”„ **Configuration System**

**Current Issue**: No user preference management
```bash
# No way to set defaults or preferences:
# - Default VDB
# - Default output format
# - Default embedding model
# - Custom aliases
```

**Recommendation**:
- Add configuration file support
- Allow setting user preferences
- Support for environment-specific configs

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Next Phase)
1. **Standardize command patterns** - Remove remaining inconsistencies
2. **Add default VDB support** - Reduce repetitive typing
3. **Improve output formatting** - Add JSON/YAML output options

### Medium Priority (Future Enhancements)
1. **Configuration system** - User preferences and defaults
2. **Batch operations** - Handle multiple resources efficiently
3. **Advanced formatting** - Custom output formats and templates

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Plugin system** - Extensible command architecture
2. **Advanced scripting** - Better integration with automation tools
3. **Custom themes** - User-customizable output styling

## Completed Improvements Summary

### âœ… **Command Suggestions & Examples**
- Intelligent typo correction with "Did you mean..." functionality
- Comprehensive command examples for all operations
- Contextual help with next steps after operations

### âœ… **Interactive Features**
- Interactive resource selection when names aren't provided
