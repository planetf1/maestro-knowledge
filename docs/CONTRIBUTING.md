### Vector Database Development

When working with vector databases:

1. **Follow the abstraction pattern**: All vector database code should implement the `VectorDatabase` interface
2. **Create separate files**: New implementations should be in separate files (e.g., `src/db/vector_db_pinecone.py`)
3. **Add tests**: Include comprehensive tests in separate test files (e.g., `tests/test_vector_db_pinecone.py`)
4. **Update factory function**: Add new database types to `create_vector_database()` in `src/db/vector_db_factory.py`
5. **Documentation**: Update [VECTOR_DB_ABSTRACTION.md](VECTOR_DB_ABSTRACTION.md) with new implementations
6. **Update compatibility layer**: Add imports to `src/vector_db.py` for backward compatibility

### Adding New Vector Database Support

To add support for a new vector database:

1. **Create implementation file**: `src/db/vector_db_[name].py`
2. **Create test file**: `tests/test_vector_db_[name].py`
3. **Update factory**: Add new type to `create_vector_database()` in `src/db/vector_db_factory.py`
4. **Update compatibility layer**: Add import to `src/vector_db.py`
5. **Update documentation**: Add new database to `VECTOR_DB_ABSTRACTION.md`
6. **Add environment variables**: Document required environment variables

Example for adding Pinecone support:

```python
# src/db/vector_db_pinecone.py
from .vector_db_base import VectorDatabase

class PineconeVectorDatabase(VectorDatabase):
    def __init__(self, collection_name: str = "MaestroDocs"):
        super().__init__(collection_name)
        # Initialize Pinecone client
        
    @property
    def db_type(self) -> str:
        return "pinecone"
        
    # Implement all required methods...
```

## Style Guides

### Python Style Guide

* Use 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Keep lines to a maximum of 79 characters
* Use docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods
* Use spaces around operators and after commas
* Follow PEP 8 guidelines
* Include warning filters for clean output in test files

### JavaScript Style Guide

* Use 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Keep lines to a maximum of 100 characters
* Use semicolons
* Use single quotes for strings unless you are writing JSON
* Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide

### Documentation Style Guide

* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)
* Reference methods and classes in markdown with the following syntax:
  * Reference classes with `ClassName`
  * Reference instance methods with `ClassName#methodName`
  * Reference class methods with `ClassName.methodName`
* Update documentation in the `docs/` directory
* Keep the main `README.md` focused on quick start and overview

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

* `bug` - Issues that are bugs
* `documentation` - Issues for improving or updating our documentation
* `enhancement` - Issues for enhancing a feature
* `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
* `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed
* `invalid` - Issues that can't be reproduced or are invalid
* `question` - Further information is requested
* `wontfix` - Issues that won't be fixed
* `vector-db` - Issues related to vector database implementations

## Development Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure that:

1. All tests pass (`./tests.sh`)
2. The code is properly formatted
3. Documentation is updated
4. New tests are added for new functionality
5. Warning filters are included for clean test output

### Test Organization

The test suite follows the modular structure:

- **Base tests**: `test_vector_db_base.py` - Tests for abstract base class
- **Implementation tests**: `test_vector_db_[name].py` - Tests for specific implementations
- **Factory tests**: `test_vector_db_factory.py` - Tests for factory function
- **Compatibility tests**: `test_vector_db.py` - Tests for compatibility layer

Each test file should:
- Include appropriate warning filters
- Use mocking to avoid external dependencies
- Test both success and error cases
- Include proper cleanup in teardown methods
